btech mini project
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a chronic eye disease that affects people with diabetes and can lead to vision loss if left untreated. It is a leading cause of blindness in diabetic patients.
 
Early detection and treatment can prevent severe vision loss. Machine learning algorithms have shown great potential in detecting diabetic retinopathy from retinal images. 

The objective of our project is to implement multi class supervised machine learning algorithm that could classify the given input images under multiple classes. The accuracy of the ML model will be evaluated using performance metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.
